I am a beginner programmer currently studying ICT Engineering. <br>
My strong enthusiasm for acquiring new skills motivated me to leave my job as a nurse <br>
and pursue programming instead.
In my free time, I enjoy documenting my learning process through coding examples <br> 
and notes, 
which I hope will be helpful to others as well. 
I invite you to explore my work—I’m excited to share my <br> programming 
journey and appreciate your support as I continue to grow and learn!
